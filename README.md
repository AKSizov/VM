# GPU Passthrough Windows 10 Setup
This is my GPU accelerated windows 10 VM machine setup that I use for gaming.
Tested on Arch Linux, but anything else should work too.
## Hardware
These scripts works fine on a muxless laptop with an RTX 2080 and an i9-9980HK.
AMD might be supported, have not tested.
